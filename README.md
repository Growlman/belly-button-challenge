# belly-button-challenge

### In this assignment, I was assigned to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

### Please be aware that I am still troubleshooting the hyperlink to the dashboard. I tried putting the repository on GitHub Pages, but when I set up the hyperlink I receive a 404, so there is something I am still missing, having to further review the documentation.
